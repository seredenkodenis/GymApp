# GymApp


[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger)

GymApp is a project that implements a simple communication of clients with the management of the gym. We can help small gyms to start their own coll website and use payment system!
The main objective of this project is to:
- Enable clients to control their training progress
- Buy online subscriptions
- Have 24/7 contact with the administration
- notify of the end of the subscription


# New Features!

  - Add photo to your profile
  - Admin can write blogs


You can also:
  - contact the administration
  - control your weight with our diary
  - set up a training schedule
  - pay for an online membership


This is only a small part of what we have done, we plan to further develop the project and add new features!

### Tech

GymApp uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [Ace Editor] - awesome web-based text editor
* [markdown-it] - Markdown parser done right. Fast and easy to extend.
* [Twitter Bootstrap] - great UI boilerplate for modern web apps
* [jQuery] - duh


### Installation

GymApp requires [Java](https://www.java.com/ru/) v8+ to run.

Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

```sh
$ cd dillinger
$ npm install -d
$ node app
```

For production environments...

```sh
$ npm install --production
$ NODE_ENV=production node app
```

### Plugins

Dillinger is currently extended with the following plugins. Instructions on how to use them in your own application are linked below.

| Plugin | README |
| ------ | ------ |
| Dropbox | [plugins/dropbox/README.md][PlDb] |
| GitHub | [plugins/github/README.md][PlGh] |
| Google Drive | [plugins/googledrive/README.md][PlGd] |
| OneDrive | [plugins/onedrive/README.md][PlOd] |
| Medium | [plugins/medium/README.md][PlMe] |
| Google Analytics | [plugins/googleanalytics/README.md][PlGa] |


### Development

Want to contribute? Great!

Dillinger uses Gulp + Webpack for fast developing.
Make a change in your file and instantaneously see your updates!

Open your favorite Terminal and run these commands.

First Tab:
```sh
$ node app
```

Second Tab:
```sh
$ gulp watch
```

(optional) Third:
```sh
$ karma test
```
#### Building for source
For production release:
```sh
$ gulp build --prod
```
Generating pre-built zip archives for distribution:
```sh
$ gulp build dist --prod
```
### Docker
Dillinger is very easy to install and deploy in a Docker container.

By default, the Docker will expose port 8080, so change this within the Dockerfile if necessary. When ready, simply use the Dockerfile to build the image.

```sh
cd dillinger
docker build -t joemccann/dillinger:${package.json.version} .
```
This will create the dillinger image and pull in the necessary dependencies. Be sure to swap out `${package.json.version}` with the actual version of Dillinger.

Once done, run the Docker image and map the port to whatever you wish on your host. In this example, we simply map port 8000 of the host to port 8080 of the Docker (or whatever port was exposed in the Dockerfile):

```sh
docker run -d -p 8000:8080 --restart="always" <youruser>/dillinger:${package.json.version}
```

Verify the deployment by navigating to your server address in your preferred browser.

```sh
127.0.0.1:8000
```

#### Kubernetes + Google Cloud
